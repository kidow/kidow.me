Kotlin runs on the Java virtual machine, has 100% interoperability with Java, and has better handling of failures and safety. Kotlin can be used to replace or extend applications written in the Java language. Also, it is very suitable for Android app development. Kotlin is easy to write code because of its simple syntax and high readability. It supports both functional and object-oriented programming, and has many safety features for null isolation and coping. Kotlin also provides an asynchronous programming feature called coroutines. Coroutines make it easy to implement an asynchronous programming paradigm. Kotlin also has rich support for popular IDEs like Android Studio, and is one of the languages ​​officially supported by Google for Android app development. In summary, Kotlin is a statically typed language developed by JetBrains that is 100% compatible with Java and provides safety, readability, coroutines and many other features for Android app development. Mostly Java-based projects and easy to use, there are various tools and libraries provided for Android app development."
